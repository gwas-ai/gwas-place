# r/place ie Pixel Democracy

Every gwas website has a secret /place that humans can leave their mark on. This will follow the same rules that reddit followed back in 2015 or whatever it was. Here are some example hidden r/place spots.

gwas.ai/c/place
gwas.io/c/place
gwas.chat/c/place
gwas.lol/c/place
gwas.us/c/place
gwas.bet/c/place

There are some 100 odd gwas TLDs currently and people who engage the project via their local app can leave their pixels as they wish.
